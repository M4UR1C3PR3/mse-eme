          <h1 id="content-creation">Content Creation</h1>
          <p>This section describes several open source tools along with scripts we have developed to transcode/transrate, encrypt (with one or more DRMs), and perform DASH segmentation/packaging of existing MP4/H.264 content.</p>

          <p>For creating content, we have explored options both in the open-source and commercial spaces. While the tools documented below may not represent an exhaustive list of the options available in either space, they provided the shortest path to achieving desired levels of functionality for the project.  We have mostly focused on content that follows the <a href="http://dashif.org/white-papers/">DASH-AVC/264</a> guidelines as established by the <a href="http://www.dashif.org">DASH Industry Forum</a>.</p>

          <p>For our evaluation, we received a functionality-limited version of the commercially available <a href="http://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/en/fame/projects/current_projects/famium/index.html">FAMIUM</a> toolset from Fraunhofer FOKUS.  The FAMIUM tools are capable of transcoding for ABR and encrypting the resulting content (using CommonEncryption) with Microsoft PlayReady.  Please contact Fraunhofer directly for more information about their tools.</p>

          <h2 id="transcoding">Media Transcoding/Transrating</h2>
          <p>The first step in creating DASH content is to transcode your high-quality source content to AVC/H.264 video and AAC audio in various resolutions and bitrates.</p>

          <h3 id="ffmpeg">FFMpeg</h3>
          <p>From open-source offerings, we chose <a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org">FFMpeg</a> for transcoding and transrating.  You may also alse have used libAV <a href="http://www.libav.org">ffmpeg</a> , which is a fork of the project and still maintains some compatibility with ffmpeg as far as command-line structure and usage is concerned. Therefore, it may be possible to take some of these instructions and use them with libAV instead.  All build instructions below have been tested on Ubuntu 13.10 but may work on any Debian-based Linux distribution.</p>

          <p>First install the basic components for git and software compilation.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo apt-get install essential-build git yasm</code></pre>

          <p>For transcoding video to H.264 and AAC-LC you will need to build ffmpeg from source, with those components enabled.  First you must install the development libraries for libx264 and libfdk-aac.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo apt-get install libx264-dev libfdk-aac-dev</code></pre>

          <p>Then get the ffmpeg sources from git. Configure, build, and install.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ git clone git://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git
$ cd libav
$ ./configure --enable-nonfree --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-libfdk-aac
$ make
$ sudo make install</code></pre>

          <p>Once you have ffmpeg built, you have a wide variety of choices for generating your adaptive bitrate streams. You must run <span class="code">ffmpeg</span> once for each adaptive profile.  Below is an example that will generate 2 adaptive streams (AVC High @ L3.1) at 2Mb/s and 3Mb/s:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ ffmpeg -i input_720p.mov
          -codec:v libx264 -profile:v high -level 31 -b:v 2000k
          -codec:a libfdk_aac -profile:a aac_low
          abr_720p_h264-2Mb-high-3.1_aac-lc.mp4
$ ffmpeg -i input720p.mov
          -codec:v libx264 -profile:v high -level 31 -b:v 3000k
          -codec:a libfdk_aac -profile:a aac_low
          abr_720p_h264-3Mb-high-3.1_aac-lc.mp4</code></pre>
          <p>Here is a more complex example that produces 5 adaptive profiles with varying bitrates, H.264 profiles and levels, and scaled resolutions (all with 1 audio bitrate transcoded to AAC-LC):</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ ffmpeg -i input_1080p.mov -vf "scale=w=512:h=288"
          -codec:v libx264 -profile:v main -level 21 -b:v 360k
          -codec:a libfdk_aac -profile:a aac_low
          abr_512x288_h264-360Kb_aac-lc.mp4
$ ffmpeg -i input_1080p.mov -vf "scale=w=704:h=396"
          -codec:v libx264 -profile:v main -level 30 -b:v 620k
          -codec:a libfdk_aac -profile:a aac_low
          abr_704x396_h264-620Kb_aac-lc.mp4
$ ffmpeg -i input_1080p -vf "scale=w=896:h=504"
          -codec:v libx264 -profile:v high -level 31 -b:v 1340k
          -codec:a libfdk_aac -profile:a aac_low
          abr_896x504_h264-1340Kb_aac-lc.mp4
$ ffmpeg -i input_1080p.mov -vf "scale=w=1280:h=720"
          -codec:v libx264 -profile:v high -level 32 -b:v 2500k
          -codec:a libfdk_aac -profile:a aac_low
          abr_1280x720_h264-2500Kb_aac-lc.mp4
$ ffmpeg -i input_1080p.mov -vf "scale=w=1920:h=1080"
          -codec:v libx264 -profile:v high -level 40 -b:v 4500k
          -codec:a libfdk_aac -profile:a aac_low
          abr_1920x1080_h264-4500Kb_aac-lc.mp4</code></pre>
          <p>While the previous ffmpeg examples produce multi-bitrate files which could be suitable for some uses, our goal is to create content suitable for the DASH-AVC/264 interoperability points provided by the DASH-IF.  These guidelines require a couple of things.  First, audio and video data may not be multiplexed into a single stream.  Second, each DASH segment may vary from its expected duration by no more than 50%, so we need to ensure that our segmenter will find sufficient I-Frames to support this. The following script (<a href="">located in GitHub)</a> will produce streams that meet all of our requirements.</p>

          <p>This script makes separate calls to <span class="code">ffmpeg</span> for each bitrate and for each audio or video component which provides the demultiplexed output we require.  Additionally, the script ensures that I-frames are spaced evenly apart at 1 second intervals.  The <span class="code">ffprobe</span> ffmpeg utility is used to detect the framerate of the source media after which the <span class="code">keyint</span> and <span class="code">min-keyint</span> x264 arguments dictate the keyframe interval.  The <span class="code">noscenecut</span> argument ensures that ffmpeg does not insert arbitrary I-frames when it detects a visual scene change in the source content.</p>
          <h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
          <p>All of the examples in this documentation will use the ISO Common Encryption standard for ISO BMFF files (ISO 23009-7). The Common Encryption specification defines a single set of encryption parameters for all content to make the decryption process more simple and consistent across players.  The following restrictions are enforced:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>AES 128-bit block encryption</li>
            <li>CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or CTR (Counter) Block Modes</li>
            <li>64-bit or 128-bit Initialization Vectors</li>
            <li>128-bit Key IDs</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In addition to the required encryption standards, the specification defines several new boxes that describe how encrypted content is to be represented in ISO BMFF containers.  These new boxes indicate which tracks within the media have encrypted samples and which samples within that track are actually encrypted.  Each set of encrypted samples is assoicated with an encryption key ID.  It is possible to have alternating sequences of encrypted and unencrypted samples.  It is also possible to have multiple encryption key IDs associated with various samples throughout the media.  However, each contiguous set of encrypted samples may only be encrypted by a single key ID.</p>
          <p>The box that contains DRM-specific information is called the 'pssh' (Protection System Specific Header).  This box contains all the information the CDM and/or player application will need to retrieve decryption keys from the DRM-specific license server.  The following sections desribe how to use our tools to encrypt the content and build and insert one or more DRM-specific 'pssh' boxes.</p>

          <p>To encrypt our ABR content, we use the open-source <a href="http://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/mp4box/">MP4Box</a> tool from the <a href="http://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/">GPAC</a> project (maintained by <a href="http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/">Telecom ParisTech</a>).  Please note that it is possible to do some forms of non-CommonEncryption using the MP4Box tool, but it will not be covered in this documentation.  We have added features and fixed many bugs in MP4Box over the course of our development, so we recommend that you download one of the <a href="http://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/downloads/gpac-nightly-builds/">nightly builds</a> or build it from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=84101">source</a>.</p>

          <p>The basic usage of MP4Box for content encryption is:</p>

          <pre><code>MP4Box -crypt &lt;cryptfile&gt; -out &lt;outputfile&gt; &lt;inputfile&gt;</code></pre>

          <p>A helper script is provided with our tools to execute the MP4box encryption process on multiple files.  This is very helpful when encrypting multiple ABR content files.</p>

          <div class="well">
            <pre><code class="scrollable-code">$ ./encrypt.sh

          <h3>CryptfileBuilder</h3>

          <p>CableLabs has developed a set of tools to assist in the generation of <em>MP4Box cryptfiles</em>.  A cryptfile is the primary input to MP4Box that describes exactly how the content should be encrypted.  A cryptfile also specifies the contents of any 'pssh' boxes to be inserted into the encrypted content.  One of the CableLabs tools, CryptfileBuilder, is a Java library on top of which you can develop your own DRM-specific cryptfile generator applications.  It defines the basic building blocks for MP4Box cryptfiles including bitstream (<span class="code">&lt;BS&gt;</span>), crypt track (<span class="code">&lt;CryptTrack&gt;</span>), and key (<span class="code">&lt;key&gt;</span>) elements.</p>

          <p>A top-level <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> build script is provided to build all of the current cryptfile generators.  The build script is located in <span class="code">create/encrypt</span> subfolder of the source repository.  You must have Ant and Java installed on your system and available in your executable PATH.</p>

          <p>Using MP4Box to do Common Encryption is pretty well documented <a href="http://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/mp4box/encryption/common-encryption/">here</a>.  In the following sections we detail several DRM-specific tools CableLabs has developed using the CryptfileBuilder library.</p>

          <h3 id="playready">Microsoft PlayReady</h3>

          <p>Microsoft provides <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/playready/documents/">several documents</a> that describe the PlayReady DRM system.  These documents detail the DRM metadata that is inserted in content files along with special instructions for doing PlayReady content protection in MPEG-DASH. The first step in creating PlayReady encrypted content is to generate your encryption keys.</p>

          <h4 id="playready_keygen">Encryption Key Generation</h4>

          <p>Microsoft has made a <a href="http://playready.directtaps.net/pr/doc/customrights/">test license server</a> available for developers who wish to test their implementations.  This server can accept query string arguments that apply different attributes to the returned license based on the desired content rights.  Since we can not store our own encryption keys in the test license server, we need a way to ensure that the keys we use to encrypt our content will be the same keys that are returned by the license server upon playback.  Microsoft has defined an algorithm (detailed at the end of <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/0/2/202E5BD8-36C6-4DB8-9178-12472F8B119E/PlayReady%20Header%20Object%204-15-2013.docx">this document</a> in the section titled <b>Content Key Algorithm</b>) that developers can use to generate their own keys based on a unique <i>key seed</i> assigned to the server and a user-defined <i>key ID</i>.  The CableLabs cryptfile generator for PlayReady will generate encryption keys according to this algorithm along with a few other crucial pieces of data required for the encyption process.  Here is an example of a generated encryption key and checksum based a specified key ID.  The binary-encoded forms of the key ID (discussed more later) are also shown.</p>

          <div class="well">
            <pre><code>===============================================

          <h4>PlayReady Header Object</h4>

          <p>The data contents of the 'pssh' box as described by the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/0/2/202E5BD8-36C6-4DB8-9178-12472F8B119E/PlayReady%20Header%20Object%204-15-2013.docx">Microsoft documentation</a> is the PlayReady Header Object (PRO).  The PRO is a list of PlayReady <em>records</em>.  Records can be of various types, but the only one we will be concerned with is the <b>rights management header</b> (type 0x0001).  The rights managment header is a UTF-16 little-endian encoded XML document designated by the top-level Windows Rights Management Header element (WRMHEADER).  Here is an example rights management header generated internally by our PlayReady cryptfile builder:</p>

          <div class="panel panel-success">
            <div class="panel-body">
              <pre><code>&lt;WRMHEADER xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/DRM/2007/03/PlayReadyHeader" version="4.0.0.0"&gt;
  &lt;DATA&gt;
    &lt;PROTECTINFO&gt;
      &lt;KEYLEN&gt;16&lt;/KEYLEN&gt;
      &lt;ALGID&gt;AESCTR&lt;/ALGID&gt;
    &lt;/PROTECTINFO&gt;
    &lt;KID&gt;AAAAEAAQABAQABAAAAAAAQ==&lt;/KID&gt;
    &lt;CHECKSUM&gt;5TzIYQ2hrOY=&lt;/CHECKSUM&gt;
    &lt;LA_URL&gt;http://playready.directtaps.net/pr/svc/rightsmanager.asmx?PlayRight=1&amp;amp;UseSimpleNonPersistentLicense=1&lt;/LA_URL&gt;
  &lt;/DATA&gt;
&lt;/WRMHEADER&gt;</code></pre>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The rights management header in this example conforms to version 4.0.0.0.  The Microsoft documentation also describes a version 4.1.0.0 rights management header that contains the same data, but it a little more compact.  We haven't been able to get content to play properly when using the 4.1.0.0 header as of the writing of this document.</p>

          <p>You can see two values in the rights management header that we pulled from the key generation process.  The first value (Checksum, Base64) goes into the <span class="code">CHECKSUM</span> element.  The other value (Content Key ID, Base64, MS binary) goes into the <span class="code">KID</span> element.  This is the base64 and binary-encoded key ID that we associated with our encryption key.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guid#Binary_encoding">Microsoft's method for binary-encoding GUIDs</a> is little bit different than what you expect. The first 8 bytes are divided into 3 fields of 4 bytes, 2 bytes, and 2 bytes.  Each field is encoded using native byte ordering (little-endian on x86 systems).  The last 8 bytes are always encoded big-endian, regardless of the native OS. Look closely at the output of the PlayReadyKeygen tool to see the difference between the original key ID and the binary-encoded key ID.</p>

          <h4>PlayReady Cryptfile Generator</h4>

          <p>Our PlayReady Cryptfile Generator tool performs all of the previous steps to create a cryptfile that will allow MP4Box to encrypt multiple tracks (potentianlly with multiple keys per track).  Here is an example of what a complete PlayReady cryptfile would look like:</p>

          <p>Let's look at the bottom portion of the file first.  You can add a <span class="code">CrypTrack</span> element for each track in the content that you want to encrypt (identified by its track ID from the Track Header ('tkhd') box).  Within that element, you can specific one or more encryption keys and associated key ID.  If you provide more than one key, use the <span class="code">roll</span> attribute of the <span class="code">CrypTrack</span> element to indicate how many samples should be encrypted with each key.</p>

          <p>The <span class="code">DRMInfo</span> element defines the 'pssh' box that will be inserted into the encrypted content.  As per the Common Encryption spec, the DRM type is identified by the 16-byte GUID "System ID" field followed by the DRM-specific data.  The <span class="code">CrypTrack</span> element identifies a track within the source media to be encrypted and associates one or more encryption key/keyID pairs to perform the encryption.</p>

          <p>There are a few fine details about how the WRM header object XML must be formatted in order to be properly parsed by a PlayReady CDM.  This information is provided simply for a better understanding of the PlayReady DRM syntax -- the cryptfile generation tool takes care of all of these details for you.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>There can be no whitespace anywhere within the XML, except to separate XML attributes within an element.<em><b>This step is essential.</b></em>  If you leave even a single newline character in the file, the CDM will not successfully parse it.</li>
            <li>When outputting the XML for insertion into the PSSH, you must use UTF-16, little-endian encoding</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The entire process of generating a PlayReady cryptfile has been rolled up into a single tool in <span class="code">playready/cryptgen</span>.  Check out the arguments and options you can pass to this tool:</p>

  &lt;track_id&gt; is the track ID from the MP4 file to be encrypted.
  After the '&lt;track_id&gt;:', you can specify either a file containing key IDs OR a
  comma-separated list of key IDs.  Key IDs are always represented in GUID form
  (xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx). Multiple key IDs indicate the use of
  rolling keys.

    &lt;keyid_file&gt; is a file that contains a list of key IDs, one key ID per line.

    &lt;keyid&gt; is a key ID in GUID form.

  -out &lt;filename&gt;
    If present, the cryptfile will be written to the given file. Otherwise output will be
    written to stdout.

  -version {4000|4100}
    If present, specifies the WRMHeader version to generate.  Must be either '4000' for v4.0.0.0
    or '4100' for v4.1.0.0.  Default is '4000'.

  -url &lt;license_url&gt;

    'http://playready.directtaps.net/pr/svc/rightsmanager.asmx?PlayRight=1&amp;UseSimpleNonPersistentLicense=1'

  -roll &lt;sample_count&gt;
    Used for rolling keys only.  &lt;sample_count&gt; is the number of consecutive samples to be
    encrypted with each key before moving to the next.

  -ck
    Add ClearKey PSSH to the cryptfile.

  -cp

          <h3 id="widevine">Google Widevine</h3>

          <p>Generating cryptfiles for Widevine DRM is also supported by the tools.  In order to use the tools, you must have contacted Google to setup your own Widevine portal.  After setting up the account, you will be given a provider name, signing key and initialization vector, and URLs for license creation and retrieval.  For encrypting content, the Widevine server will create key/keyID pairs based on a given contentID (String) and media type (HD, SD, or AUDIO).  The server will also return a PSSH box that can be placed in the media during the encyrption process.  The CableLabs cryptfile tool actually does not use this Widevine-generated PSSH and instead generates its own.  Mostly this was done since the PSSH format is public and we wanted to ensure that we could generate one ourselves.  Google uses its <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Protocol Buffer</a> to serialize the PSSH data into a compact format suitable for the PSSH.  The basic structure of the protobuf looks something like this:</p>

          <h3 id="clearkey">ClearKey</h3>

          <p>The EME spec mandates browser support for a Simple Decryption system called <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html-media/raw-file/default/encrypted-media/encrypted-media.html#simple-decryption-clear-key">ClearKey</a>. ClearKey is a "test" DRM in which keys are, at some point, exposed over the network or to Javascript applications.  The spec defines the ClearKey system string (org.w3.clearkey) and the format of decryption key data passed to the <span class="code">MediaKeySession.update()</span> API. We wanted to develop a simple implementation in our tools that would show evidence of support (or lack of support) for Clear Key in browsers.</p>

          <h4 id="cenc">Common Encryption</h4>

          <p>In previous versions of the EME specification, the ClearKey PSSH box was not defined, so CableLabs was forced to define its own.  Today, the EME <a href="https://w3c.github.io/encrypted-media/initdata-format-registry.html">Stream Format and Initialization Data Format Registry</a>, which describes how initialization data is to be carried in various media containers, defines the <a href="">cenc</a> initialiation data type for ISO Common Encryption.  Within this cenc registry entry, the ClearKey system ID (<span class="code">1077efec-c0b2-4d02-ace3-3c1e52e2fb4b</span>) and the PSSH box format is called out.  It identifies the ClearKey PSSH as a "Version 1" ISO CommonEncryption PSSH box which contains all KeyIDs used by the media.</p>

          <p>We have enough now to allow us to create ClearKey-encrypted media, but the spec stops at that point.  The process of obtaining ClearKeys is left up to the implementer.  The CableLabs EME platform implements two examples ways to access these keys.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Decryption key(s) contained within the player application.  The dash.js player's ClearKey implementation will look inside a ProtectionData object that can be associated with a media asset.  In the <a href="https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/tree/development/samples/dash-if-reference-player">example player application</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/blob/development/samples/dash-if-reference-player/app/sources.json">JSON file</a> contains a large set of test media for trying out the player.  The JSON description for each asset can also specify the ProtectionData object and any clearkeys associated with it.  At playback-time, the player will automatically load these keys into the ClearKey CDM.</li>
            <li>Decryption key(s) retrieved from a remote server (similar to real DRMs).  Keys may be transported securely over the network (e.g. via HTTPS) and are only in the clear within the javascript code running on the browser.  CableLabs has implemented a very primitive, node.js-based <a href="https://github.com/cablelabs/mse-eme/tree/master/create/encrypt/clearkey/server">ClearKey license server</a> that takes KeyIDs as query parameters and returns the associated keys from a hard-coded list.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3 id="cenc">Common Encryption Multi-DRM</h3>

          <p>One of the fundamental benfits of Common Encryption is the ability to encrypt content once while still supporting multiple proprietary DRM systems.  Up until this point, we have only demonstrated the encryption of content using a single DRM.  This section takes what we have learned in the previous sections and describes how to use MP4Box to encrypt a piece of content with multiple key systems that can be played back on the disparate platforms that support those systems.</p>

          <p>With MP4Box, it is quite simple to apply multiple DRMs to a piece of content;  you just add multiple <span class="code">&lt;DRMInfo&gt;</span> elements to the cryptfile.  Each one will introduce a new 'pssh' box into the content. </p>

          <p>There is an interesting caveat when using our tools to do multi-DRM Common Encryption;  KeyID and decryption key must be the same across all DRMs.  Content samples are only encrypted with a single key/keyID.  Multiple keys can be used to encrypt a single piece of content (rolling keys), but only a single key per individual media sample.  With the PlayReady test server, we can't install our own keys manually.  We must rely on the key generation algorithm.  Luckily, our Clear Key test server is completely under our control and we can simply install the same key generated by the PlayReady algorithm.  In commercial deployments, DRM license servers must support the manual installation of keys so that a single content encryption process can select the keyID and key and then install it across all DRM servers.</p>

          <p>As stated earlier, our current situation is that we only have control of both keys and key IDs from within our ClearKey environment.  The other DRMs we are using have test servers that control the generation (or at least the method of generation) of encryption keys.  Therefore we can currently only do multi-DRM encryption with ClearKey and one other.  Please note the <span class="code">-ck</span> arguments supported by our cryptfile generation tools.  Refer to the specific tool's help message (-h arg) for more information.</p>

          <p>As you can see, the tools lets you include all of our other supported DRMs when generating the cryptfile!</p>

          <p>The DRMToday service provides a REST API that our tools use to communicate with the licensing service.  In order to call these APIs, the tools must know some information about your subscription to the DRMToday system.  This comes in the form of a Java properties file and it has the following structure:</p>

          <div class="well">
            <pre><code class="scrollable-code">merchant=my_merchant_id
username=username
password=thisisaterriblepassword
authHost=lic.drmtoday.com
feHost=fe.drmtoday.com</code></pre>
          </div>

          <p>Each organization registered with DRMToday receives a unique merchant ID that is used to associate your requests with the services you have purchased.  Then, one or more users are assigned to the organization with the rights to call the DRMToday REST APIs.  Each user is assigned a unique username and password.  castLabs uses a ticket-based, Central Authentication Service (CAS) for authenticating access to their APIs.  Before calling the APIs, you must contact the DRMToday authorization host to receive a "ticket" that will be used in future API calls.  Finally, DRMToday operations are performed using the REST APIs at the frontend (fe) host.

          <p>When using the tools, you must specify a unique <em>assetID</em> and an optional <em>variantID</em> to identify a piece of content.  Key/KeyID pairs will be created for you and delivered securely to the DRMToday license server for ingest.  Do not use the same assetID multiple times as you will get an error from DRMToday API call to indicate that keys for that asset already exist.  There is a REST API for deleting keys, but it is not supported by the tools at this time</p>

          <h2 id="packaging">DASH Segmenting and Packaging</h2>

          <p>The final step in the content creation process is to segment/index our media files and then create a DASH manifest file (.mpd).  Our test tools create content that attempts to adhere to the DASH-AVC/264 guidelines.  Therefore, we are restricted to a subset of the functionality that appears in the MPEG-DASH specification.  MP4Box, once again, is our tool of choice for performing DASH segmenting and packaging.  MP4Box supports a large assortment of command-line options when DASHing content.  You can run <span class="code">MP4Box -h dash</span> to see a complete description of all options.  The basic usage of the tool looks likes this:</p>

          <pre><code>MP4Box -dash &lt;seg_duration&gt; -profile &lt;profile&gt; -out &lt;mpdfile&gt; &lt;inputfiles&gt;</code></pre>

          <ul>
            <li><span class="code">&lt;seg_duration&gt;</span> is the requested duration of each media segment after segmentation</li>
            <li><span class="code">&lt;profile&gt;</span> is the desired MPEG-DASH profile (onDemand, live, main, simple, etc...)</li>
            <li><span class="code">&lt;mpdfile&gt;</span> is the location and filename of the DASH Media Presentation Description file that will be written</li>
            <li><span class="code">&lt;inputfiles&gt;</span> specifies the input media files that will be parsed  and segmented to produce new output media files.  There will be one Representation in the MPD file for each input file specified.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>isobmff-ondemand Profile</h3>

          <p>For On-Demand (VOD) content, MP4Box will produce a single fragmented MP4 file for each audio/video/text component of your input video across each ABR profile.  If your input contains multiplexed A/V data, the output files from MP4Box will be de-multiplexed audio and video in separate files; one for each ABR bitrate.  In fact, DASH-AVC/264 guidelines require demultiplexed content and separate Adaptation Sets for each A/V component.  Here is an example command line from one of our scripts that creates DASH On-Demand content:</p>

          <pre><code>MP4Box -dash 10000 -rap -bs-switching no -sample-groups-traf \
  -profile onDemand -out bbb_720p_h264_enc.mpd \
  $content_root_dir/bbb_720p_h264-2Mb-high-3.1_aac-lc_enc.mp4#video:id=2Mb \
  $content_root_dir/bbb_720p_h264-2Mb-high-3.1_aac-lc_enc.mp4#audio:id=audio \
  $content_root_dir/bbb_720p_h264-3Mb-high-3.1_aac-lc_enc.mp4#video:id=3Mb</code></pre>

          <p>With this command we are generating MPEG-DASH content with 10 second segment duration from 2 video bitrates and 1 audio bitrate.  Audio and video Representations will be separated into their own AdaptationSet. The important takeaways from that command are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><span class="code">-rap</span> This indicates that each segment must begin with a random access point (I-frame).  Using this option, segment durations may not be exactly what you requested due to the fact that RAPs might not land exactly on those time boundaries.</li>
            <li><span class="code">-bs-switching no</span> At the time, Google Chrome could not handle anything other than <b>avc1</b> and <b>avc2</b> type ISOBMFF tracks (SPS/PPS stored in the sample entry).  Without this option, MP4Box would generate <b>avc3</b> type tracks (SPS/PPS stored inband in the samples themselves).  This may have changed with later versions of chrome.</li>
            <li><span class="code">-sample-groups-traf</span> The standard MP4Box behavior when generating fragmented MP4s is to place Sample Group Description ('sgpd') boxes in the Movie ('moov') box and the corresponding Sample To Group ('sbgp') boxes in the Movie Fragment ('moof') boxes.  This behavior is not allowed by the <a href="http://www.uvvuwiki.com/images/c/cb/CFFMediaFormat-1.1r1.pdf">DECE Common File Format</a> specification.  Microsoft's Internet Explorer 11 will <em>only</em> parse media files that conform to the CFF.</li>
            <li><span class="code">#video:id=2Mb</span> These suffix arguments to our input files tell MP4Box to do several things.  First, it allows us to tell MP4Box to demultiplex our mulitplexed input files and to use the first video (<span class="code">#video</span>) or audio (<span class="code">#video</span>) track from the file for a particular Representation.  It also allows us to specify attribute values on the Representation elements (id, bandwith, xlink, role) in the generated MPD.  Multiple attributes can be specified, separated by commas.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Here is an example MPD generated from command line shown above.  The content was encrypted using our Common Encryption tools with Microsoft PlayReady.  As you can see, there is no indication that PlayReady DRM is being used or if more than one DRM available to decrypt the content.  All of that is hidden by Common Encryption and will be discovered by the client player application at playback-time.</p>

          <p>Even though there is only one file generated for each Representation, the files are still segmented.  The player application can quickly access the segment index ('sidx') box to determine where the various segments begin and end within the file.  The <span class="code">&lt;SegmentBase&gt;</span> element tells the application exactly where the 'sidx' box is within the overall file.</p>
